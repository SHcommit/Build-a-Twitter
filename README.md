Starting on January 18, 2026, I wanna expand my development skills from iOS to <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.
I'm also interested in eventually building applications that run on desktop environments.

<strong style="font-size: 32px;">B</strong>efore starting this project, I want to clarify what I need to learn in order to build it successfully.<br>

### Learning goals

1. I'm familiar with HTML, CSS and javascript at a basic level.
2. I want to understand how browsers render UI layouts, and learn the key differences between web development and iOS development : ]
3. I want to learn how to <strong>define reusable components</strong>, design a solid architecture, and organize a proper directory structure.
4. I'm curious about how to handle responsive UI layouts across different screen sizes.
